      # does nothing.
      #
      # By convention, a returnCode of 0 means success, and any non-zero value
      # indicates an error.
      #
      # It's good practice to always connect signals to this slot using a
      # QueuedConnection. If a signal connected (non-queued) to this slot is
      # emitted before control enters the main event loop (such as before

      # Note that unlike the C library function of the same name, this
      # function does return to the caller â€“ it is event processing that stops.

      # It is necessary to call this function to start event handling. The
      # main event loop receives events from the window system and dispatches
      # these to the application widgets.

      # To make your application perform idle processing (by executing a

      #
      # We recommend that you connect clean-up code to the aboutToQuit()
      # signal, instead of putting it in your application's main() function
      # because on some platforms the exec() call may not return. For example,
      # on Windows when the user logs off, the system terminates the process
      # after Qt closes all top-level windows. Hence, there is no guarantee

      # For certain types of events (e.g. mouse and key events), the event
      # will be propagated to the receiver's parent and so on up to the
      # top-level object if the receiver is not interested in the event
      # (i.e., it returns false).
      #
      # There are five different ways that events can be processed;
      # reimplementing this virtual function is just one of them. All five
      # approaches are listed below:
      #
      # 1. Reimplementing paintEvent(), mousePressEvent() and so on. This is
      #    the most common, easiest, and least powerful way.
      # 2. Reimplementing this function. This is very powerful, providing
      #    complete control; but only one subclass can be active at a time.
      # 3. Installing an event filter on QCoreApplication::instance(). Such
      #    an event filter is able to process all events for all widgets, so
      #    it's just as powerful as reimplementing notify(); furthermore, it's
      #    possible to have more than one application-global event filter.
      #    Global event filters even see mouse events for disabled widgets.
      #    Note that application event filters are only called for objects
      #    that live in the main thread.
      # 4. Reimplementing QObject::event() (as QWidget does). If you do this
      #    you get Tab key presses, and you get to see the events before any
      #    widget-specific event filters.
      # 5. Installing an event filter on the object. Such an event filter
      #    gets all the events, including Tab and Shift+Tab key press events,
      #    as long as they do not change the focus widget.
