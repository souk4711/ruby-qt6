      # QTemporaryDir and QTemporaryFile default paths, and in some file
      # locations of QStandardPaths. Qt D-Bus, Accessibility, and the XCB
      # platform integration make use of the application name, too.

      # After this function has been called, the application leaves the main
      # event loop and returns from the call to exec(). The exec() function
      # returns returnCode. If the event loop is not running, this function
      # does nothing.
      #
      # By convention, a returnCode of 0 means success, and any non-zero value
      # indicates an error.
      #
      # It's good practice to always connect signals to this slot using a
      # QueuedConnection. If a signal connected (non-queued) to this slot is
      # emitted before control enters the main event loop (such as before
      # "int main" calls exec()), the slot has no effect and the application
      # never exits. Using a queued connection ensures that the slot will not
      # be invoked until after control enters the main event loop.
      #
      # Note that unlike the C library function of the same name, this
      # function does return to the caller â€“ it is event processing that stops.
      #
      # Note also that this function is not thread-safe. It should be called
      # only from the main thread (the thread that the QCoreApplication object
      # is processing events on). To ask the application to exit from another
      # thread, either use QCoreApplication::quit() or instead call this

      # affect this by handling the QEvent::Quit event on the application
      # level, or QEvent::Close events for the individual windows.
      #
      # If the quit is not interrupted the application will exit with return
      # code 0 (success).

      # exit() directly. Note that method is not thread-safe.

      # via quit()).
      #
      # It is necessary to call this function to start event handling. The
      # main event loop receives events from the window system and dispatches
      # these to the application widgets.
      #
      # To make your application perform idle processing (by executing a
      # special function whenever there are no pending events), use a
      # QChronoTimer with 0ns timeout. More advanced idle processing schemes
      # can be achieved using processEvents().
      #
      # We recommend that you connect clean-up code to the aboutToQuit()
      # signal, instead of putting it in your application's main() function
      # because on some platforms the exec() call may not return. For example,
      # on Windows when the user logs off, the system terminates the process
      # after Qt closes all top-level windows. Hence, there is no guarantee
      # that the application will have time to exit its event loop and execute
      # code at the end of the main() function after the exec() call.
